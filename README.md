How to run this example on windows:
From anaconda:
create a new environment and install the following libraries:
django, numpy, scipy, pandas, pillow and matplotlib.
it is also necessary the iapws. Since it is not included in anaconda, install manually:
pip install iapws
Now create and navegate to a folder for your project, ej:
cd prueba
copy the cloned folder frontendRessspi.
From prueba folder, type:
django-admin startproject frontendRessspi
now get into the folder frontendRessspi and type:
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
if an error appears is because still is not copied the offline project. So, clone a copy in "prueba" ressspi_offline.
dentro de la carpeta
it is no necessary to type python manage.py startapp FE1. Instead, copy the original content of the cloned folder FE1 and overwrite that in "prueba".
Now type again:
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
and that's it!
Finaly, open a browser and go to http://localhost:8000/
